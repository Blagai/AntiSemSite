                <h2>FAQ</h2>
                <h3>How does it work?</h3>
                <p>This extension will colour known Jewish-friendly (green) and Anti-semitic (red) users/pages differently.</p>

                <h3>Which sites are supported?</h3>
                <p>This extension supports Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, Tumblr, Medium, YouTube, Wikipedia articles, and search engines.</p>

                <h3>How does it know how to colour each page?</h3>
                <p>Manual data gathering, I might integrate machine learning or an AI into it at some point if it's not too complicated.</p>

                <h3>Does it submit the list of pages that appear on my screen?</h3>
                <p>No, the check is done offline, on your computer.</p>

                <h3>Which criteria is used to determine the label?</h3>
                <p>This extension is focused on Anti-Semitic sentiment of all flavours: Anti-Israel "progressivism", religious, alt-right, etc. Although most of the information is about the first group.</p>

                <h3>Can I see the list of pages and their labels?</h3>
                <p>Yes, but I'm not sure what ID the browser will give the extension, so I can't tell you how to do it specifically, but if you don't have many extensions, it shouldn't be too complicated to find the data.</p>

                <h3><a name="install-on-mobile">Can I use it on my phone?</a></h3>
                <p>Not yet, but I do plan on making it possible using Firefox Nightly. Note however that you won't be able to right-click (and therefore set new labels).</p>

                <h3>Is there a mechanism in place to prevent malicious/fake reports?</h3>
                <p>Yes. While your overrides are immediately visible to you, changes are included in the publicly visible dataset only if they pass some trustworthiness criteria (including human validation).</p>

                <h3>What's the origin of this extension's name?</h3>
                <p><a href="https://shinigami-eyes.github.io/">The original</a> Shinigami Eyes extension, made for trans people.</p>

                <h3>Why did you create this extension?</h3>
                <p>Both conservative and progressive communities and people have rampant anti-semitism in them. Be it "progressive" anti-semitism (the "Jews don't belong in the Middle East" people), or the straight-up nazi shit, it's anti-semitism nonetheless.</p>
                <p>The purpose of this extension is to make Jewish people feel more confident towards people, groups, and pages they can trust, and to highlight possible interactions with the anti-semitic ones.</p>

                <h3>Is this extension compatible with the original Shinigami Eyes?</h3>
                <p>As long as a user isn't marked in both extensions, yes. If a user is marked in both extensions, I don't know which will take priority.</p>

                <h3>Can the extension make mistakes?</h3>
                <p>YES. I personally have to add people to the data files, and I might make mistakes sometimes â€” if you see that, please right-click and mark as the appropriate option. There could also be false positives, for example, if someone's username includes another username in it, that person would be marked as the latter.</p>

                <h3>I disagree with your definition of antisemitic!</h3>
                <p>Sucks to suck.</p>

            <div class="section-inner">
                <h2>Guidelines: how to label</h2>
                <p>Do not flag unless you're reasonably confident about your decision. Do not mark other bigotry in any colour â€” a pro-Israel terf shouldn't be coloured at all, for example.</p>

                <h3>Not enough to mark as Anti-Semitic</h3>
                <p>Being Muslim or Arab, supporting anti-semitic political parties for other reasons, being a bad or medicore ally, etc.</p>

                    <div class="reasoning">Erasure of Jewish historical identity is anti-semitic. However, beware of people stating Jews shouldn't be allowed in other countries, having a right to go back to our homeland and being forced to go back to our homeland are very different things.</div>

                    <div class="reasoning">If a person supports Hamas or any anti-semitic terrorist organisation, whether by dogwhistles or outright stating it, that is anti-semitic. Baselessly accepting that Israel is committing genocide is also anti-semitic. Only caring about human rights when it concerns Israel also counts (Ignoring what's happening to Kurds and other groups in the world, while claiming to care about human rights "by standing up for Palestinians"). Note that just supporting a two-state solution does not count.</div>
